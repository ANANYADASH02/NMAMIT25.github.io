    <p>The full form of ECE is Electronics and Communication engineering, This is one of the most sought-after engineering courses in India after Computer science, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. Electronics and Communication Engineering involves designing, developing, and manufacturing electronic equipment (for devices and circuits) as well as communication systems. A degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering enables you with a clear understanding of analog transmission, basic electronics, microprocessors, solid-state devices, digital analog communication, satellite communication, Integrated circuits, antennae and wave progression, and microwave engineering.

        There is a thin line between the Electronics and Communication Engineering course and Electrical Engineering (EE) course that people from outside the domain tend to not understand.  While Electrical Engineering (EE) is associated with large-scale electrical systems, Electronics engineering (ECE) involves small-scale electronics systems. The ECE course details are explained clearly in this article </p>
